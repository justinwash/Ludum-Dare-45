### Possible Themes & Ideas

**Start with nothing:** 
* Adventure/puzzle game where you start with nothing, find an object of some sort, then barter your way to the end of the game [like the red paperclip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_red_paperclip)

**Unconventional travel:** 
* You play as a delivery driver that travels via wormholes that are scattered around the world and connect in seemingly random ways. Be given increasingly difficult to find deliveries such that you must memorize the connections to succeed (maybe we're in space? or a wizard thats really bad at teleportation?)

**Side Effects:** 
* The one I had for this from last jam isn't allowed anymore cause I started work on it. So how about a top-down shooter where you have 4 different gun types but can only use each one when facing a specific direction. facing upward - single-fire, facing right - auto, facing down - shotgun/spread, facing left - mine/grenade for example

**Small character, big enemies:** 
* uhh just make a 2D Shadow of the Colossus?

**Factory:** 
* A puzzle game where you put stuff on different conveyor belts to combine it into other stuff. 2048 meets tetris but with goofy physics and conveyors.

**Shelter:** 
* Physics game where you try to build a house within a certain time limit and then a storm comes and tries to knock it over. Stronger wind and rain with each level increase (or flimsier materials?)

**One item, many uses:** 
* A game where you must ward off waves of zombies with a frying pan while also trying to cook breakfast with it. Zombercooked?

**Night is coming:** 
* A stealth? racing? game utilizing casted 2D shadows where you race the setting sun by staying out of the shadows. if a shadow touches you you slow down? I don't know, whatever.

**Making connections:** 
* The wormhole idea above. Or a 'fake operating system' style hacking game where you have to connect from computer to computer to navigate a corporate network and steal trade secrets (or Trumps taxes if we wanna get political) before getting kicked off.

**Isolation:** 
* A narrative game about being literally alone in the universe. Learn about the main character and their history by floating around in space searching for specific constellations, which trigger narrative text sequences

**Duplication:** 
* Solve puzzles by making clones of yourself. After a set amount of time the clones move exactly as you do. For instance, press two buttons at once by leaving a clone in front of one, moving to the other, activating the clone, then pressing oitAlternatively clone yourself again and thus the clone also will... chaos ensues.

**Mutation:**
* The Duplication idea except your clones mutate in some way causing them to act differently or have different abilities

**Low tech:**
* A game where you build boats? Or put a rock and stick together to make a hammer? You know... THAT game.

**Take one, leave the rest:** 
* A rogue-like thing where each time you enter a new room you're given a coice between 3 abilities. After you choose you must use that ability to fight enemies that each have one of the other 2.

**Evolve to survive:**
* See Duplication/Mutuation
